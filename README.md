This mod adds the ability to level up your weapons (Currently just swords and axes)

How the mod works
Every level up will increase the weapon's overall damage by 0.1 Attack Damage. Killing different mobs will give you weapon XP(Default: Animals=2; Monsters=10; Mini Bosses=50; Boss=100). Hitting Entities will also give you 1 XP point occasionally (Default: 20% Chance). Many of the Values can be adjusted via the mod's config.
