This mod adds the ability to level up your weapons (Currently just swords and axes)

How the mod works
Every level up will increase the weapon's overall damage by 0.1 Attack Damage. Killing different mobs will give you weapon XP(Default: Animals=2; Monsters=10; Mini Bosses=50; Boss=100). Hitting Entities will also give you 1 XP point occasionally (Default: 20% Chance). Many of the Values can be adjusted via the mod's config.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The Mod is currently in Development and will allow further customization via configs and datapacks. The wither is currently considered a Mini Boss as a placeholder. This will later be changed to be a list.
